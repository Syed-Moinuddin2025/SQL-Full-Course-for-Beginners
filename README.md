# 📘 SQL Full Course for Beginners

Welcome to the **SQL Full Course for Beginners** repository! This project is designed to help you practice real SQL queries explained through YouTube tutorials. You’ll be working with a sample database named **MyDatabase**.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains step-by-step SQL queries for beginners covering basic to intermediate concepts such as:
- Creating and using databases
- Creating and altering tables
- Inserting, updating, and deleting records
- Filtering data using WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN
- Sorting and grouping data
- Using aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
- JOIN operations

> 💡 All queries demonstrated in the YouTube course are replicated here for easy reference and hands-on practice.
